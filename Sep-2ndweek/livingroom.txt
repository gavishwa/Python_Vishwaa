In the living room,I always watch TV. It's the only place I can spend my time with my family. 
Sometimes,I talk my mom and dad watching TV.My holidays are spent in the living by lying on the sofa.
But I never do my homework there.I can't concentrate well.Sounds of TV,noises from the road,my familys' conversation disturb my studying.
That's why living room is not in my list where I like to study in my house.
